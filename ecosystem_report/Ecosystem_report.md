# Ecosystem considerations for Red Snapper
sarah.roberts@noaa.gov, mandy.karnauskas@noaa.gov

Consider any known evidence regarding ecosystem, climate, species
interactions(e.g., predation studies), habitat considerations, species
range modifications(expansions or contractions), regime shifts, larval
movement between stockboundaries, and/or episodic events (for example:
upwelling events) that would reasonably be expected to affect Red
Snapper population dynamics and are appropriate for inclusion in the
stock assessment (e.g., Larval Transport Modeling, Karnauskas et
al. 2022).

## Ecosystem, climate and species interactions

- Species interactions - Lauren Gentry and David Chagaris ECOSIM/ECOPATH
  for RS

- Matt Damiano and Matt Carr miniVAST if done

## Larval movement between stock boundaries

- Karnauskas paper

- Genetic work from David Portnoy
  (<https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/79/1/12/6453068>)

- Paul rutterhousen - release mortality paper

- Will Patterson (UF) talking about David Portnoy genetic work

## Episodic events

- Upwelling can be a driver but not necessarily an episodic event. 

- Matt and Laurent Cherubin work on cold snaps. 

## Life history and seasonality

- spawning

## Habitat considerations

**Depth distribution** 

- Bacheler et al. (2021) used an acoustic positioning system of 44 red
  snapper off North Carolina in 2019 and found mean movement rate and
  distance off bottom varied by individual, with larger red snapper
  generally moving faster and spending more time farther off the bottom
  than smaller individuals. Mean hourly red snapper movement rate was
  lower during the day than at night and was negatively related to
  bottom water temperature. Moreover, red snapper spent more time off
  the bottom during the day than at night, and vertical movements were
  mostly related to bottom upwelling events that sporadically occurred
  in May–July. These results and previous observations suggest that red
  snapper feed primarily on benthic organisms at night, and display diel
  vertical migration (i.e., thermotaxis) up to warmer waters (when
  present) during the day to aid digestive efficiency. 
- (Mitchell et al. 2014) found older, larger (\>50 cm FL) red snapper
  are generally distributed throughout depths(shallow: \<29.0 m; middle:
  29.0–48.9 m; deep: ≥49.0 m), whereas younger smaller (\<50 cm FL) Red
  Snapper occurred disproportionately in shallower depths(\<29.0).

**Habitat selection** 

- Red snapper are associated with deep reef habitats in temperate and
  tropical waters in the South Atlantic from North Carolina to Florida
  and the Gulf of Mexico (Nelson and Manooch III 1982).

- Chatterjee et al. (2024) utilized movement modelling of acoustic
  telemetry data set of 35 red snapper and found that most red snapper
  selected for hardbottom habitat and for locations nearer to edge
  habitat.

- Bacheler et al. (2025) found that the relative abundance of red
  snapper has increased dramatically (∼ 1000 %) between 2011 and 2022
  based on a long-term baited trap and video survey (SERFS). Red snapper
  were most commonly observed off the east coast of Florida, Georgia,
  and, to a lesser extent, off the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Red
  snapper were most commonly observed at moderate (40 m) depths and
  displayed a positive relationship with water temperature and patchy
  reef habitat.

- Preliminary surveys from the SERFS video trap survey were sampled with
  traps and video north of Hatteras in August 2024 (baited fish traps
  with attached gopro cameras). Two days (36 samples) were in the Kitty
  Hawk Wind Energy Area (all sand, no fish), one day (18 samples) were
  offshore of the Currituck Lighthouse in a mix of artificial and
  natural areas (some black sea bass and gray triggerfish, no red
  snapper because the water was too cold ~14 C), and one day was at Avon
  Rocks just east of Avon, NC - we caught a few small red snapper that
  day in 18 traps (water was much warmer). There might be a small number
  of red snapper north of Hatteras but not many. But hard to draw too
  many conclusions from a single sampling trip north of Hatteras
  (personal correspondence with Nate Bacheler). 

**Other environmental drivers**

- salinity

- temperature

- dissolved oxygen

- climatological indices (AMO/NAO)

- primary productivity

- Gulf Stream

  - When the GS has a strong deflection (which happens in March/April)
    it facilitates the origin of the so-called “Charleston Gyre”
    (actually long lived large mesoscale eddies), which brings warm
    waters (and larvae) to the shelf, while increasing productivity with
    upwelling at the center. 

## Species range modifications

- Cao, Craig, and Damiano (2024) used reef video surveys (SERFS) and a
  joint spatiotemporal modeling framework and found no significant shift
  in red snapper centroids of distribution between 2011 and 2021
  (neither offshore nor northward)
